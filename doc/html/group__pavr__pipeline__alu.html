ALU description</b><dd>
The ALU is not a potentially conflicting resource, as it is fully controlled by pipeline stage s5. <br>
 <br>
 There are two ALU operands. The first operand is taken either from RF read port 1, if it's an 8 bit operand, or taken from RF read port 1 (lower 8 bits) and from RF read port 2 (higher 8 bits), if it's a 16 bit operand. The second operand is taken either from the RF read port 2 or directly from the instruction opcode; it is always 8 bit-wide. <br>
 Both operands are fed to the ALU through the Bypass Unit. <br>
 All ALU-requiring instructions write their result into the Bypass Unit. <br>
 Details about the ALU hardware resource (connectivity, ALU opcodes) can be found <a class="el" href="group__pavr__hwres__alu.html">here</a>. <br>
 Instructions that make use of the ALU-related pipeline registers:<ul>
<li>ADD, ADC, ADIW<li>SUB, SUBI, SBC, SBCI, SBIW<li>INC, DEC<li>AND, ANDI<li>OR, ORI, EOR<li>COM, NEG, CP, CPC, CPI, SWAP<li>LSR, ROR, ASR<li>MUL, MULS, MULSU<li>FMUL, FMULS, FMULSU<li>MOV, MOVW</ul>

Plugging the ALU into the pipeline</b><dd>
The pipeline registers related to ALU access are presented in the picture below. <br>
 From this picture, it can also easely figured out instructions' timing. <br>
