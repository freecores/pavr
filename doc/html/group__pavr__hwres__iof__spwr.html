 This the stack pointer. <br>
 It is 16 bits wide, being composed of two 8 bit registers, SPL and SPH. <br>
 The stack can reside anywhere in the Unified Memory space. That is, anywhere in the RF, IOF or DM. It can even begin, for example, in RF and continue in IOF. However, placing the stack pointer in the IOF is likely to be a programming error, as the IOF registers have dedicated functions. Quasi-random values from stack written into IOF could result, for example, in an unpredictably trigerring any interrupt, and in general, in unpredictable behavior of the controller. <br>
