 The general IO File port is a little bit more ellaborated than a simple read/write port. It can read bytes from IO registers to output and write bytes from input to IO registers. Also, it can do some bit processing: load bits (from T flag in SREG to output), store bits (from input to T bit in SREG), set IO bits, clear IO bits. <br>
 An opcode has to be provided to specify one of the actions that this port is capable of. <br>
 <br>
 The following <b>opcodes</b> are implemented for the IO File general port:<ul>
<li>read byte (needed by instructions IN, SBIC, SBIS)<li>write byte (OUT)<li>clear bit (CBI)<li>set bit (SBI)<li>load bit (BLD)<li>store bit (BST)</ul>

 Needed by instructions that manipulate IO File in stage s5: CBI, SBI, SBIC, SBIS, BSET, BCLR, IN, OUT, BLD, BST.<li>pavr_s6_iof_rq <br>
 Needed by instructions that manipulate IO File in stage s6: CBI, SBI, BSET, BCLR.<li>pavr_s5_dacu_iof_rq <br>
 Needed by loads and stores that are decoded by DACU as accessing IO File. <br>
