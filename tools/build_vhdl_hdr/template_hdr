--    pAVR (pipelined AVR) is an 8 bit RISC controller, compatible with Atmel's
--    AVR core, but about 3x faster in terms of both clock frequency and MIPS.
--    The increase in speed comes from a relatively deep pipeline. The original
--    AVR core has only two pipeline stages (fetch and execute), while pAVR has
--    6 pipeline stages:
--       1. PM    (read Program Memory)
--       2. INSTR (load Instruction)
--       3. RFRD  (decode Instruction and read Register File)
--       4. OPS   (load Operands)
--       5. ALU   (execute ALU opcode or access Unified Memory)
--       6. RFWR  (write Register File)
